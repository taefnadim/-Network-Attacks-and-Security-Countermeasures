# -Network-Attacks-and-Security-Countermeasures
Covers network attacks, including SQL injection for unauthorized access and data manipulation, with prepared statements as a countermeasure, using MySQL, Curl, PHP, and Ubuntu VM. Also demonstrates Packet Sniffing and Spoofing to capture and modify network traffic using Scapy, Wireshark, and Netcat. ARP cache poisoning enables MITM attacks on Telnet and Netcat with Python, while ICMP redirects and TCP attacks (SYN flood, TCP RST, session hijacking) disrupt routing and connections, using Wireshark, Python, and C.
